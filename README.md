ReBook2 is ***largely*** inspired by ***Pu Wang's rebook***.

Rebook2 depends on python3 and Tcl/Tk 8.6 (Tck/Tk with version lower than 8.6 doesn't work).

With your terminal go in the projet's folder and create a virtual environnement:

```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Then check activate it

```
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```

And install the dependancies

```

To check if the dependencies are correctly installed, just run

```
python3 -m tkinter
```

To run rebook, put k2pdfopt binary and rebook.py into the same directory and run `python3 rebook2.py`
